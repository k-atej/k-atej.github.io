The first independent computing project I ever completed was the final project in my first Computer Science 
at Hendrix. We were tasked with creating any kind of program that had a graphical user interface (GUI). We had just learned 
about PyGame, so it felt natural to make a game! I grew up playing Galaga with my dad, so I wanted to create something similar.
I decided to create an underwater version of Galaga, which I called "JellyGa," with jellyfish as the attackers. 

## Main Menu

The game opens on a main menu, seen above, and has three levels of increasing difficulty. Between each level is a new start screen,
which allows you to take a quick break between rounds. To kill the jellyfish, you can shoot them with bubbles. They will
shoot electricity back at you! If you are hit three times, you lose.

While this project had little to do with biology, it was my very first foray into coding, and shows just how far I've come
over the last 3 years!
